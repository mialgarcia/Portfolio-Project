Hi! I'm Mia, a finance major at the University of South Florida. I enjoy learning how financial systems work and developing skills that will help me in corporate finance and investment analysis. This repository is part of my "Launching Your Digital Brand" project, where I'm building a professional online presence and getting comfortable using GitHub.

# project_reflection.md

This project taught me how GitHub can serve as both a technical tool and a personal branding platform. I learned how to organize files, create a clean repository structure, and write a README that introduces who I am in a professional but natural way. I can see how useful GitHub will be for managing future projects, especially as I move into more advanced finance coursework or internships.

Understanding how to present myself online is important, and this assignment helped me build confidence in curating a digital presence that feels authentic and organized.
